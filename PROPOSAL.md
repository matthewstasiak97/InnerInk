## What is InnerInk

InnerInk is a personal journaling app that gives users a safe, private space to reflect, write, and track their thoughts over time. With a clean, minimal interface and session-based login, users can create, edit, and organize journal entries securely. Each entry is tied to a user, ensuring privacy and personalization. Whether it’s daily reflections, mood tracking, or creative writing, InnerInk helps users stay connected to their inner voice—one entry at a time.
